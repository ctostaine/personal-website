    <h1 align="center">Welcome</h1>
    <p align="center">Hello there! My name is Charles Tostaine and I am a Computer Science major at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN.
      My interests include computers (of course), photography, Instagram, and coffee. Yes, I guess you could say "basic" but I add a
      a twist to each of those things. Just browse through this website and you will see what I mean!</p>
